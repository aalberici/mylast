## 1. Executive Summary

The Associazione Farmaceutici Industria (AFI) requires a comprehensive modernization of its digital platform. The current system, which includes a member management system (gestionale) and web portal that have been iteratively developed over approximately 15 years, has become increasingly difficult to maintain, presents security vulnerabilities, and incurs unpredictable costs for modifications and enhancements. As AFI continues to grow in significance within the Italian pharmaceutical industry, a more robust digital infrastructure is essential to support its approximately 2,300 members and expanding activities.

After extensive analysis of the existing systems and consultation with key stakeholders, this document outlines a comprehensive modernization approach that addresses current pain points while creating a sustainable foundation for future growth. The proposed solution employs a modern, modular architecture with three primary components:

First, an Evolutivo BPM-based management system will handle all aspects of member administration, financial operations, and data management. Second, a headless CMS website using Strapi and Plasmic will provide a secure, modern interface for both public information and member services. Third, a Discourse forum platform will facilitate community engagement and collaboration among AFI members and study groups.

This architecture represents a significant departure from the current WordPress-based implementation, prioritizing security, maintainability, and user experience. By physically separating frontend and backend systems, implementing modern authentication mechanisms, and leveraging purpose-built technologies for each component, the solution dramatically reduces potential attack vectors while improving flexibility for future enhancements.

The implementation plan provides a phased approach that carefully manages risk during the transition, with particular attention to ensuring system readiness for the critical January membership renewal cycle. The timeline allows for thorough testing and data migration, minimizing disruption to AFI's operations while providing clear communication to members throughout the process.

## 2. Current State Analysis

### 2.1 Existing Systems Overview

AFI currently operates with a digital ecosystem comprising several interconnected components that have evolved over time to meet the association's growing needs.

The central member management system (gestionale) was developed approximately two years ago, replacing a previous Access-based solution that had become obsolete. This system handles core membership functions including registration, renewals, and payment processing. It maintains member records across various categories—Ordinary, Honorary, Extraordinary, Adherent, Student, and Benefactor—each with distinct attributes and fee structures. The system also generates receipts for payments, produces financial reports, and manages the annual membership cycle including renewals and transitions for non-paying members.

The association's primary web presence, www.afiscientifica.it, operates on WordPress with numerous plugins and custom components accumulated over many years. This site serves both as a public information portal and as a member-restricted area where users can access association resources, participate in study groups, and manage their membership details. The site includes forum functionality using BuddyPress, which provides spaces for study groups to communicate, albeit with limited functionality by modern standards. The portal allows members to self-select study groups of interest and participate in related discussions and activities.

A separate WordPress installation at simposio.afiscientifica.it supports AFI's symposium events, offering information for attendees and a platform for exhibitors to create and manage their virtual booths. This component includes basic functionality for exhibitors to upload logos, descriptions, and materials for their company profiles, though the customization options remain limited.

The current architecture employs separate databases for the gestionale and the WordPress sites, with synchronization mechanisms that occasionally lead to data inconsistencies. Payments are processed through an integration with Nexi, which has experienced timing issues between payment processing and receipt generation, causing reconciliation challenges for accounting purposes.

### 2.2 Key Challenges

Through extensive analysis of the current systems and detailed discussions with AFI stakeholders, several critical challenges have emerged that necessitate this modernization initiative.

From a technical perspective, the WordPress implementation with its multiple plugins presents significant security vulnerabilities. As noted by technical stakeholders, WordPress's widespread usage makes it a prime target for attackers, with each additional plugin increasing the attack surface exponentially. The separation of databases between the gestionale and website creates synchronization issues, particularly for member data and group participation. The forum functionality provided by BuddyPress is outdated and lacks modern social features that members have come to expect from collaborative platforms. Performance issues arise during peak usage periods, particularly during the January renewal cycle when many members access the system simultaneously.

From a business process perspective, the current approach to system maintenance has created financial unpredictability. Each change request or issue correction typically incurs variable costs without clear forecasting ability, creating what stakeholders described as "death by a thousand cuts" financially. Financial reconciliation has been particularly problematic, with timing discrepancies between Nexi payment processing and receipt generation. For example, payments made at month-end often post in the following month, while receipts generate immediately, creating accounting discrepancies that require manual reconciliation. Year-end member transition processes have been unreliable, with the system failing to properly identify and transition non-renewed memberships, resulting in communications being sent to expired members.

The user experience suffers from an outdated interface with limited mobile responsiveness. Members have expressed frustration with the forum system's poor usability and the lack of calendar integration for study group meetings. The collaborative features are insufficient for document sharing and co-editing, limiting the productivity of study groups. Exhibitors find the symposium site restrictive in terms of the media and information they can present to potential attendees.

Administrative staff face inefficiencies due to manual processes that could be automated. For instance, the system lacks the ability to automatically generate calendar invitations for virtual meetings, requiring staff to create and send these separately. The reporting capabilities are limited, often requiring manual data extraction and manipulation for oversight requirements.

These challenges collectively hinder AFI's ability to serve its members effectively and maintain its position as a premier organization in the pharmaceutical industry. The proposed modernization directly addresses these pain points while creating a foundation that can adapt to AFI's evolving needs.

## 3. Business Objectives

The AFI Platform Modernization project aims to achieve several critical business objectives that directly address current limitations while positioning the association for future growth and enhanced member service.

Foremost among these objectives is improving the security posture of AFI's digital assets. The current WordPress implementation with numerous plugins presents substantial security risks that could compromise member data or disrupt service. The new architecture must significantly reduce these vulnerabilities through a comprehensive security approach, including separating presentation layers from data management, implementing modern authentication mechanisms, and creating isolation between critical system components.

Enhancing the member experience represents another crucial objective. As AFI's membership continues to grow and diversify, providing an intuitive, responsive, and feature-rich digital experience becomes increasingly important for member retention and engagement. The new platform must deliver a modern interface across all devices, streamlined processes for membership management, and robust collaboration tools for study groups and professional networking.

Administrative efficiency stands as a key operational objective. The current system requires significant manual intervention for routine tasks such as membership approval, payment reconciliation, and report generation. The modernized platform should automate these processes wherever possible, freeing staff resources for higher-value activities and reducing the potential for human error in critical operations.

Financial accuracy and transparency form an essential objective for regulatory compliance and organizational governance. As a non-profit entity, AFI must maintain impeccable financial records with clear audit trails. The new system must ensure complete reconciliation between payments and receipts, provide comprehensive financial reporting, and maintain historical records that meet audit requirements.

Enabling more effective collaboration among members represents a strategic objective for advancing AFI's mission of professional development and knowledge sharing. The current forum system fails to provide the interactive, multimedia-rich environment necessary for productive professional exchange. The modernized platform should offer sophisticated collaboration tools, seamless meeting integration, and robust document sharing capabilities that facilitate meaningful interaction among members.

Establishing cost predictability for ongoing maintenance and enhancement addresses a significant financial management challenge. The current approach has led to unpredictable expenditures that complicate budgeting and financial planning. The new solution must provide clear, predictable cost structures for regular maintenance and planned enhancements, allowing for more effective financial stewardship.

Finally, creating a sustainable foundation for future evolution represents a forward-looking objective that acknowledges AFI's dynamic nature. The pharmaceutical industry continually evolves, and AFI's digital platform must adapt accordingly. The new architecture should provide the flexibility to incorporate new features, integrate with emerging technologies, and scale with membership growth over a 5-10 year horizon without requiring wholesale replacement.
